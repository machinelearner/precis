#### Setup
* Install Python 2.7.x
* Install virtualenv to manage packages
* Install packages from eggs.txt
* Install nltk data packages, from prompt execute these

```bash
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv .env # this creates environment for this application
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -r eggs.txt
python nltk_setup.py
```

or Use ```make``` shipped with this project

```bash
make env
source .env/bin/activate
```

#### Usage
* After the setup you can run the following script against a document directory with a list of documents belonging to
